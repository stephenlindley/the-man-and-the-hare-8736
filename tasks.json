Drawn by a relic carved from myth and moonlight, he is thrust into a conflict older than Camelot itself. Balor, the god of endings, has broken free. His shadow poisons the rivers, empties villages, and turns despair into an army. To stand against him, the man must walk the seam between worlds: the everyday soil under his feet, and the ancient realm that breathes just beneath it. Guided by Merlin, hunted by Mordred, and joined by the fae who remember the first dawn, he becomes something neither wholly mortal nor wholly legend, a vessel for the land's last hope. As Camelot burns and the old powers wake, he must choose what he is willing to become, and what he is willing to lose, to keep the world from slipping into oblivion. The Man and the Hare is a meditation on transformation, belonging, and the thin boundary between the ordinary and the eternal. Rooted in Celtic myth and told with the stark beauty of a dying dawn, it is a story of a man finding his place in a world where field and legend share the same breath, and where the land remembers, even when its people forget.'), author information (Stephen Lindley), prominent call-to-action button linking to Amazon UK (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0G819RYX9), book details (Publication: December 15, 2025, Pages: 112, Genre: Fantasy/Celtic Mythology/Arthurian, Rating: 5.0/5 stars, ISBN: 979-8277364819), and overall mystical, mythological aesthetic that feels ancient and timeless","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":1},{"description":"Refine the hero section typography to be more striking and impactful - experiment with letter spacing, font weights, and hierarchy to make the book title more commanding and memorable","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":2},{"description":"Verify the CTA button correctly links to https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0G819RYX9 - ensure it opens in a new tab","type":"bug","passes":true,"id":3},{"description":"Add an atmospheric background image to the hero section - generate or source a mystical Celtic landscape image (misty ancient stones, ethereal dawn light, mythological atmosphere) and integrate it as a hero background with proper overlay to ensure text readability","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":4},{"description":"Add the hero background image from ./hero-background.png as the background for the hero section.
